			<h1>Ruolin Chen <small>(pronounced roll-Leen)</small></h1>
			<p>Currently a master's student at the University of Washington, studying Information Management (User Experience specialization). From various class projects and internship experiences, I have grown my passion in understanding human behaviors and using problem-solving skills to build inclusive designs and experiences for people. I love collaborating with teams to create easy-to-navigate interfaces on mobile and web-based platforms.</p>
			<p>I have been living in Seattle for 10+ years. Outside of school and work, I like to enjoy the nature and hiking near water.</p>
