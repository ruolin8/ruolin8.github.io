        <h1>01. Overview</h1>
        <p>JoyOS is a class project on prototyping a new operating system that targets users who want to form a healthier relationship with their phone devices. Our main focus is to create a mindful, seamless, and personalized OS that solves users' painpoints in several aspects.</p>
        <img src="img/joyos overview.png">
        <h2>Problem Space</h2>
        <p>How might young adults improve their engagement with mobile devices so that it promotes mindfulness and meaningful interactions?</p>

    <div class="project-text">
        <h1>02. Research</h1>
        <p><b>Questions asked:</b><ul>
            <li>What are some things you like and dislike about using your phone?</li>
            <li>What do you do currently to promote personal wellness?</li>
            <li>What does mindfullness mean to you?</li>
            <li>Are there any factors regarding your OS that contribute negatively to your mental wellness?</li>
            <li>Have you ever used a personal wellness application and if so, how was your experience?</li></ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Insights</h2>
        <p>Based on 7 interviews with college students in Seattle, we have found their painpoints and generated a design principle to build our mobile operating system.</p>
        <p class="insights">a) <b>Unhealthy</b> relationship with their mobile devices.<br>b) Mobile devices are convenient, but <b>distracting</b> and spend much time on social media.<br>c) Users need a more <b>mindful</b> OS that faciliate wellness activities and reduce the <b>overusage</b> of their devices.</p>

        <h2>User Personas</h2>
        <p>Our next step was creating two user personas that helps us to identify different user groups and seeking target features that best fits them, as well as making future iterations.</p>

        <h2>Initial Sketches & Wireframe</h2>
        <p>These are whiteboard sketches and wireframes that present the ideas of our design pattern that helps us to stay consistent throughout the design process.</p>

        <h2>Design Critiques</h2>
        <p>After a series of design critiques in class. Our lecturer and classmates have given a few important comments that are notable to revise in our final design sprint.</p>
        <p>a) Focus on the <b>users</b> and your design, donâ€™t care about people buying the accessories. <br>b) When you brainstorm, good that you show your audiences about <b>painpoints</b>. <br>c) Each persona is a good use of space. How does your design <b>target</b> these user groups? <br>d) About design principles: softer color palettes can be problematic! <b>Test</b> these colors on an actual device.</p>
