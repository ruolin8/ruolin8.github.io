        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Transparency Portal is a website that tracks City of Seattle spending of COVID-19 federal relief funds (also known as the <b>Seattle Rescue Plan</b>). This is a platform open to anyone who is interested in knowing how the City uses fundings in five areas of need: Housing & Homelessness, Community Well-being & Reopening Services, Supporting City Workers & Services, Community & Small Business Recovery, and Community Safety & Mental Health.</p>

        <h2>Problem Space</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The goal of creating the Transparency Portal is to show the audience with data visualizations and context to better understand the work that the City have done to help residents during the pandemic. A few questions that our team discussed: <b><br>1. What are the key objectives? <br>2. Who is the audience? <br>3. What programs are useful to highlight? <br>4. How to turn useful data into visualizations?</b></p>

        <hr>
        <p>I was a summer intern that worked with the Seattle Rescue Plan team. The desktop version of the Portal was nearly finished when I joined. Afterward publishing in the end of July, I helped with optimizing the website by building the mobile and tablet versions of it, as well as adding new contents under project highlights.</p>
        <p>Step 1. Resize and rescale</p>
        <p>Step 2. Modify visualizations</p>
        <p>Step 3. New contents</p>
        <p>Step 4. Review and reflection</p>
