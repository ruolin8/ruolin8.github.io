        <h1>01. Overview</h1>
        <p>The Seattle Rescue Plan website tracks City of Seattle spending of COVID-19 federal relief funds. This is a platform open to anyone who is interested in knowing how the City uses fundings in five areas of need: Housing & Homelessness, Community Well-being & Reopening Services, Supporting City Workers & Services, Community & Small Business Recovery, and Community Safety & Mental Health.</p>

        <h2>Problem Space</h2>
        <p>The goal of creating the Seattle Rescue Plan website is to show the audience with data visualizations and context to better understand the work that City of Seattle has done to help residents during the pandemic. Prior research has been done by another team, data sets were provided to me at the beginning of my internship. A few questions that our team had discussed:</p>
        <p>a) What are the <b>key objectives</b> of our portal? <br>b) Who is the audience? <br>c) Which programs have sufficient <b>data to be highlighted</b>? <br>d) How to turn <b>useful data into visualizations</b>?</p>

        <h1>02. Design</h1>
        <p>I was a summer intern at City of Seattle who worked with the Seattle Rescue Plan team. The desktop version of the Portal was nearly finished when I joined. After publishing in the end of July, I helped with optimizing the website by building the mobile and tablet versions of it, as well as adding new data visualizations under project highlights.</p>
        <h2>Final Version</h2>
        <h3>Rescale and modify visualizations</h3>

        <h1>03. Reflection</h1>
        <p>Over the two month of my internship, I have gained experience of working with a team and partcipate in design critiques as well as creating iterations. There are certain limitations with ArcGIS Experience Builder and my team tried our best to match the City's style guide. If there are alternative choices like programming from scratch, we might have the opportunity to optimized the UI. Since I joined the team towards the launching date, I was able to quickly learn the tool and listen in meetings and providing suggestions from a new perspective. Our main question is why should we put this visualization on the page and what data does it tell to the audience? I wrote a instruction on how to update the mobile and tablet version. On the last day, I presented the 4 new web pages that were added to the website. </p>
