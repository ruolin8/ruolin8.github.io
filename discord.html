        <h1>01. Overview</h1>
        <p>Discord is described as a place where people can spend time with friends or others who share the same interest via an online platform. Gamers, influencers, and social groups are the regular users of Discord in the favor of its unique features such as channels, roles, and permissions to organize small to large online communities. Despite the playful aspects of design and functionality attracting users for entertainment, it also has a great <b>opportunity to develop a professional version</b>. This project focuses on expanding the concept to <b>enhance collaboration</b> among users in a more professional setup for online and hybrid teams.</p>

        <h1>02. Research</h1>
        <h2>Method 1: Online Review</h2>
        <p>Our team searched on Discord's Feedback forum and captured some user reviews under the <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/360030253991-Discord-for-Business">Discord for Business</a> topic.</p>
        <img src="img/discord research.png">
        <h2>Method 2: Surveying</h2>
        <p>We chose to conduct a survey as our research method approaching current users with Google Forms and received 40 responses. One of the questions is "<b>For what purpose do you use Discord?</b>" and found that about majority of the users selected gaming and general communication. In conclusion, 47.5% are interested in using Discord for Work and 45% have not yet buy in to this idea. Therefore, we target users who selected "maybe" in hoping it could be turned to a "yes" with our design prototype.</p>

        <h1>03. Design</h1>
        <p>We tried to follow Discord's design system since our target users are current users with a range of experiences using this platform. Adding productivity features could help users better organize resources and time.</p>
